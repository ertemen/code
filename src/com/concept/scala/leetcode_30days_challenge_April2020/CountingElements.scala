  *
  *      Given an integer array arr, count element x such that x + 1 is also in arr.
  *
  *      If there're duplicates in arr, count them seperately.
  *
  *
  *
  *      Example 1:
  *
  *      Input: arr = [1,2,3]
  *      Output: 2
  *      Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.
  *      Example 2:
  *
  *      Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
  *      Output: 0
  *      Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there's no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.
  *      Example 3:
  *
  *      Input: arr = [1,3,2,3,5,0]
  *      Output: 3
  *      Explanation: 0, 1 and 2 are counted cause 1, 2 and 3 are in arr.
  *      Example 4:
  *
  *      Input: arr = [1,1,2,2]
  *      Output: 2
  *      Explanation: Two 1s are counted cause 2 is in arr.
